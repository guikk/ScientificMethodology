In my opinion, the problem raised by Popper is very relevant and continues being important nowadays. Perhaps political fanatism grows with the same ideas that base irrefutable theories, some vague statements that might be true at some point, but have been changed so much to avoid refutation that they don't mean much either.

Looking up at the conclusions he formulated before studying a hypothesis is a good way of staying away from being tricked by intuition and encouraging the search for good reasoning.

# Lecture Homeworks Log Journal
##  Lecture 1
- [X] Read Popper’s text
- [X] Indicate your name on the Pad. You will use to collaborate and fill in all the information you can.
- [X] Register on the Mattermost through this invitation link. This is the preferred communication mode.
- [X] Set up a public github or gitlab project for this lecture. You will take notes on this lecture and turn your homework and computational documents in this project.
- [X] Register to the MOOC on Reproducible Research
- [X] Follow modules 1 + 2 of the MOOC with as much exercises as possible (except the last one of module2, on Challenger; watching interviews is optional)
- [X] Set up a computational document system (e.g., Rstudio or Jupyter on your laptop or through the UGA JupyterHub).
- [X] Report the URL of your git project, your mattermost ID on the Pad.

## Lecture 2
- [X] Start learning R by reading this R crash course for computer scientists (Rmd sources) (slides 14-20)
- [ ] Complete the two data analysis/visualization in a clean R notebook and upload in your github/gitlab space. Make sure we can easily find it when landing on your page. :)
- [ ] MOOC: Complete exercise 5 of module 2 (Challenger). Write a short text explaining what is good and wrong about this document (you may want to provide an updated version of the notebook) and upload on your github/gitlab space.

## Lecture 3
- [ ] See previous homeworks and provide links in the Pad!
- [ ] First name/last name analysis in a computational document.

## Lecture 4
- [X] Use good naming and organization conventions in your repos.
- [ ] See previous homeworks: use dplyr and ggplot for the first/last name analysis! Complete challenger if you haven’t done so.
- [X] If you have time, git a try to git-annex but no worry if you can’t. What’s important is that you know it exists, what it allows to do, and that it is not so difficult to use.
- [X] Engage in module 3 of the MOOC and chood a topic for the peer evaluation (final task of module 3).

## Lecture 5
- [X] Continue the hands-on, improve the experiment design and the analysis

## Lecture 6
- [X] Write an in-depth report using a computational document with a decent data management/statistical treatment (i.e., with confidence intervals or regions!).
**Subject Choice** -> Subject 7: The SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) epidemic.

## Lecture 10
- [ ] Start playing with this DoE Shiny Application: [](https://adaphetnodes.shinyapps.io/design_of_experiments/?abc1111) where you should replace abc1111 by your own id (pick one on the pad by writing your name in front of it).

## Lecture 11
- [ ] Keep playing with the DoE Shiny Application (https://adaphetnodes.shinyapps.io/design_of_experiments/?abc1111 but with your own id) to experiment with screening and LHS designs or with Gaussian-Process based exporation.
- [X] Choose a topic for the lecture on Ethics. Prepare a short (1-page) summary with the context (addressed problem and solution 50%) and your opinion about the pros and cons of the proposed technology (50%). Prepare also 2 slides to possibly present the problem to the class.

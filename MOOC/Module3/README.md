# MOOC Module 3 Log Journal

# Exercise 03
## Ex. 03-1
> Downloaded the notebook file from Gitlab. Then, replaced the data reading method with the following steps:
> - Check if data file already existed with `os.path.exists()`
> - If not, download from URL using `wget` (Jupyter lets you run linux bash commands using the `!` sign)

## Ex. 03-2
> Edited a copy of the notebook to use the chickenpox data, had some difference in missing data and start year, but overall very similar  data.

In the end I got as a result 2010 being the worst year, different from the MOOC answer (2009). I couldn't figure out why this happened, maybe I didn't fetch the exact same dataset. In the other hand, the best year result was the same.

# MOOC Module 2 Log Journal

# Exercise 02
## Ex. 02-1
> I also have worked for some time with Jupyter Notebooks in 2019, when I was doing undergradute reseach in visual analytics. It was good to remember some features of it by building this notebook. 

(Probably a reason to explore Rstudio to learn someting new)

## Ex. 02-2
> No problem to compute the values, `numpy` did all the hard work :)

## Ex. 02-3
> In this exercise I really could easily plot the graphs right away, but had to look a bit for documentation over the grid and scales. (Same as everytime I use `matplotlib`)

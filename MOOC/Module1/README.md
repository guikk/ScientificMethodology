# MOOC Module 1 Log Journal

# Exercise 01
## Ex. 01-1
> Gitlab was already a tool I used a lot in an internship, so I was very familiar with the search tools.
## Ex. 01-2
> As well as Gitlab I had already some experience with markdown to write Wikis and work logs. Specially, I find the Gitlab Flavored Markdown very easy to use and with features available to cover every need I had.  
 
> Originally wrote it in the embedded MOOC repository, then copied the file to here.
